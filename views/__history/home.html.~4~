<h2>Lehigh Valley Amateur Radio Club</h2>
<!-- <h3>Outline</h3> -->
<p>W3OI-The Lehigh Valley Amateur Radio Club (LVARC) was started in 1928, making it one of the oldest ham (amateur) radio clubs in the area.  The club has regular club meetings and monthly activities. We have a monthly newsletter, the <a href="#/newsletter">VOX</a>. Hams and non-hams are invited to visit and spend as much time as they need to view the newsletters, meeting dates and activities as well as links to other ham radio related sites!</p>
<p>As well as being a club related to ham radio, the LVARC is a social club and a service organization, as members serve the public by providing communications support for many community events. Our repeaters support that service philosophy by providing a controlled radio communications environment for club members and mobile operators in the Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p>The LVARC has close ties to and works closely with, the <a href="http://ema.lehighcounty.org">Lehigh County Emergency Management Agency</a>, RACES (Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service) and ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service).</p>

<h3>Meetings and Nets</h3>
<p>The LVARC meets the FIRST TUESDAY of EVERY MONTH at the Tri-Clover Fire Company in Orefield at 7:30 pm for a monthly business meeting and technical presentation on subjects of interest to the ham radio community.  All hams and persons interested in ham radio are welcome.</p>
<p>On the THIRD TUESDAY of EVERY MONTH we have a more informal 'Hands On Night',¬ù which involves demonstrations of ham radio equipment and techniques.</p>
<p>On Monday nights at 7:30pm the club has a different kind of 'meeting' on the air called a traffic net.  Members and non-members can check in and hone their emergency traffic handling skills as part of the net.  The net takes place on the primary repeater used by the club on 146.94 Mhz.  Messages, bulletins and traffic are handled by the net control station.  Tune in for announcements of upcoming meetings and club events.</p>
