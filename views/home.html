<h2>Lehigh Valley Amateur Radio Club</h2>
<!-- <h3>Outline</h3> -->
<p><b>W3OI</b> - The Lehigh Valley Amateur Radio Club (LVARC) was established in 1928, making
 it one of the oldest ham (amateur) radio clubs in the area.  The club has
 regular club meetings and monthly activities. We have a monthly newsletter,
 called the <a href="#/newsletter">VOX</a>. The VOX contains information
 regarding our club meetings, the club's planned events, events of interest to
 the radio amateur, and articles of interest to the ham community.
 Hams and non-hams are invited to visit
 and spend as much time as they need to view the newsletters, meeting dates
 and activities as well as links to other ham radio related sites!</p>
<p>As well as being a club related to ham radio, the LVARC is a social club
and a service organization, as members serve the public by providing
communications support for many community events. Our repeaters support that
service philosophy by providing a controlled radio communications environment
for club members and mobile operators in the Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p>The LVARC has close ties to and works closely with, the
<a href="http://ema.lehighcounty.org">Lehigh County Emergency Management
Agency</a>, RACES (Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service) and
ARES (Amateur Radio Emergency Service).</p>
<p>The LVARC is registered as a 501(c)3 organization with the
Internal Revenue Service.</p>

<h3>Meetings and Nets</h3>
<p>The LVARC meets the FIRST TUESDAY of EVERY MONTH at the
<a href="#/location">Tri-Clover Fire
Company in Orefield</a> at 7:30 pm for a monthly business meeting and technical
presentation on subjects of interest to the ham radio community.  All hams
and persons interested in ham radio are welcome.</p>
<p>On the THIRD TUESDAY of EVERY MONTH we have a more informal
<a href="#/moprogs">'Hands On
Night'</a>,¬ù which involves demonstrations of ham radio equipment and techniques.</p>
<p>On Monday nights at 7:30pm the club has a different kind of 'meeting' on
the air called a traffic net.  Members and non-members can check in and hone
their emergency traffic handling skills as part of the net.  The net takes
place on the primary repeater used by the club on 146.94 Mhz.  Messages,
bulletins and traffic are handled by the net control station.  Tune in for
announcements of upcoming meetings and club events.</p>
