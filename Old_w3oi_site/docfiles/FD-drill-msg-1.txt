The US, from the Mississippi river east, has been experiencing frequent brown outs and black outs due to 
the extended duration of the unseasonably severe hot and humid weather.  The power grid is currently stressed 
to the breaking point.  While terrorist activity has been discounted, it cannot be completely ruled out.

The local EMA office has asked radio amateurs to plan for a possible situation where they could provide both local 
VHF/UHF coverage within the valley as well as long haul communications to areas outside the affected zone.  
They would like the site to be "local" (i.e. within a few miles of downtown).  The LVARC, as a member of 
Lehigh County RACES, is looking at locations within five miles of center city Allentown to support this requirement.  
We would deploy to and commence communications if needed.  Our initial period of operation is planned to be 24 hours, 
with extensions added if the situation requires.  An ADVON team is currently surveying potential areas.  

The next situation update message will be within 48 hours.  
(Simulated time 1930 hours local, 6/25/08; actual 1945 local 6/3/08)

To support our deployment I am looking for a shelter chief (setup and manage shelter area), a site 
planner (antenna location and leads) and a food specialist.  Contact me via email if you want to help.
