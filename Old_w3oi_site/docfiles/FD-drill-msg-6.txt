Field Day Message #6
Simulated Time 2330 UTC Sunday, June 29th, 2008

Earlier today the local EMA released the W3OI/LVARC communications site.  Operations were secured today at
1300 local time.  The emergency management agency passes along its thanks to those hams who helped during the crisis.

As of now, power has been restored to over 95% of the Eastern US.  Moderating weather in the affected areas along 
with the isolation of a defective segment of the power grid allowed the power companies to repair the problems.  For
now, no severe weather is expected.
