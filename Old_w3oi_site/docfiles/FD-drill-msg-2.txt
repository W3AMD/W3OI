The advanced echelon (ADVON) team has found a suitable site for our potential deployment in support of the EMA.  Their 
batteries were going  but I managed to copy the location information as FN20fo, I repeat FN20fo.  And I did hear 
someone shouting Indianapolis in the background, but I'm not sure what that means.  They'll be back in contact as 
soon as they charge their batteries.

They will need three volunteers to manage the setup along with all available club members to operate 
the station when deployed.  The three volunteers needed NOW are a shelter construction management chief, 
a food team chief and a site setup chief.  Volunteers for the three positions can submit their names to me, N0KIA.
