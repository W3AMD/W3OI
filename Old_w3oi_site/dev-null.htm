What...you want I should make a list for you.  You're a ham.  Fire up the old rig and <EM>LISTEN</EM>!  You may even want to try <B>HF</B>.  I hear there's signals over there as well...
<p>
Seriously, if you want to see a list of Lehigh Valley frequencies here, send one to me.  Any format - .txt, .rtf, .lwp, .doc, .xls, .csv, .tsv, etc.,.  I'll be happy to publish it.  At least it'll show someone is reading the club page!!!
<P>
Send your info to <A HREF="mailto:N0KIA@ARRL.NET">N&Oslash;KIA@ARRL.NET</A> and I'll compile whatever I get.  Thanks...
