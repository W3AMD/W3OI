<H2>Possible LVARC Presentations</H2>
</CENTER>
<P>We're looking for presenters for the following topics, or any interesting topic of your choice, to present at a club meeting.
 Presentations may be anywhere from 10 to 60 minutes long, and in some remote way should relate to amateur radio or emergency services.
 Visual aids are welcome since our attention span is limited.  <P>You have a wealth of experiences to share 
 even if you only have a year or two of hamming under your belt.  You really do have something to share.  
 You know you do.  This is probably the 
 most unthreatening group in the Lehigh Valley to stand in front of and share your radio experiences.  Give it a try.  
 <P>Contact Phillip Bigg (KB3HMK, PHILBERT@ENTER.NET) if you'd like to present something below or with your own program ideas and suggestions.
