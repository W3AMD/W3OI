Reference: W3OI Monthly Meeting on March 1.

Greetings Fellow Digital Ops,

If you are bringing your laptop computer and have FLDIGI installed, please
use this configuration guide. If you would have your system configured this
way, it will save a good bit of time at the meeting.

The link to the configuration guide is:

NOTE from N3XG:  FLDIGI is a free program and can be found on the net and
installed on any portable computer with a soundcard (working speakers and
microphone) and then brought to the March meeting so that you can play along
with Ed from your seat.

NOTE from N0KIA:  The link above seems to be out of date.  
Use the setup instructions link on our web page just to the right of
the link that got you here.  Thanks.
