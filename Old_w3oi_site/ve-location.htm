VE Testing Location</H1>
</center><FONT size=3>
<P>We test at the Red Cross of the Lehigh Valley building.  It's located at:
<PRE>
    2200 Avenue "A"
    Bethlehem, PA  18017-2157
</PRE>
That's very near the Lehigh Valley International Airport so if you can get there, you're close!
<P>
There's a <A HREF="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=2200+Avenue+A,+Bethlehem,+PA+18017&ie=UTF8&z=15&om=1&iwloc=addr">map</A> available if you need it.<P>
I'll assume you can find route 22 somehow.  From 22 take the Airport Road North exit to the first light.  That's avenue "A".  Turn right and proceed down Avenue "A" about 0.2 miles.  The Red Cross building is the three story structure on your left just before the stop sign.  It has a sign indicating it's the Red Cross building and an American Flag out front. There's plenty of parking in the lot.  Enter from the rear building entrance and proceed to the testing room, #102, on the first floor.
