	While Seranova provides a workable field day solution, it shouldn't be the only site we use.  Indeed, we should be looking to rotate among other sites to experience typical challenges that an emergency operation would encounter.  We need the President to empower others to seek and evaluate those locations.  We could revisit Seranova again in 2007 and beyond.

	The site is nice and offers the options needed.
The point of it not being in lehigh county ?
I would go along with the group.
With my schedule I never seem to have the time
to fully enjoy the event. MY Thoughts   73 Carl

	I like the fact it is away from the public and we can pretty much do whatever we want.....If we would go someplace new, a priority for myself would be to have those same "freedoms". Otherwise, it is not really a big deal where we have it. I can understand that people would like to have it in Lehigh County (it makes sense, we are a Lehigh County affiliated group...even though for Field day it does not matter), but I'm not ready to abandon Seranova just yet

	My field day site ideas MUST include permanent shelter of some kind if I am bringing my equipment. This does not mean tents, tarps or half baked canopies. I will be happy to bring two radios (as in the past) with complete antenna and tuner fixtures for everyone and anyone to use, but there must be shelter in case of inclement weather. Sleeping quarters would also be nice again not tents or on ground areas. In short, my idea of the perfect and most of all ideal  site is Serranova.  73 NR3R/Larry

	Depending on date, my site (top of south mtn,
sw of Emmaus, s of Macungie) may be available.
It would be a tent/camper type of thing, but
a great RF location.

	I like Mack South Side Fire Station. 
1.It has places to set up equipment and operate.
2.It is very convenient to string up antennas from the top of the fire tower to the fence lines for any band, and you can also erect verticles on the top or the side of the tower.
3.It is very accessible from any direction.
4. The only thing you must have is a van, motor home or tent in case of very inclement weather.

	We need to schedule ops for time slots.  Stick to a certain number of stations and leave it at that.  This way new members can learn how to operate HF next to someone that has done it before.  It will also cure the radio jitters if someone is slotted next to a mentor.  More interest is during the day, so make those slots shorter time periords.  Less interest at night, make them longer periods.  Just an idea.
